## Scenario
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing offering. Company success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. We want to understand how casual riders and annual memebers use Cyclistic bikes differently. The team is looking to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Ask

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I am assigned the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

#### **Business Task:** Analyze Cyclistic riding data to understand differences between casual riders and annual members to convert current users into annual members.
